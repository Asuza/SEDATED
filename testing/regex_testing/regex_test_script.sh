#### Script name: regex_test_script.sh
#### Authored by: Dennis Kennedy and Simeon Cloutier
#### Description: The SEDATED regular expression testing script used in conjunction with 
####              testing/regex_testing/test_cases.txt is a simple, quick, offline way to 
####              test/validate that the regular expressions inside config/regexes.json 
####              are valid and matching the desired patterns as well as excluding/not 
####              matching as desired.
####

### ! MUST USE GNU GREP, BSD GREP WILL GIVE ERRONEOUS RESULTS ! ###
### ! SEDATEDâ„  USES GNU GREP, BSD GREP DOES NOT HAVE A -P FLAG ! ###
